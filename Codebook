## Project Description
This contains tidy data of two separate raw files of kids names, that were cleaned and merged for example use.

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
Data was collected from the following github:
https://github.com/BivinSadler/MSDS-6306-Doing-Data-Science.git/Unit 5

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
The two separate raw data files are separated by different parameters, a ";" and "," so please note that when 
separating out columns

##Creating the tidy datafile
The columns will need to be separated in both files.

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Raw data files are separated by different parameters, a ";" and "," so please note that when 
separating out columns
The 2015 data has a duplicate name that ends in "yyy", so please be sure to remove it when tidying

###Cleaning of the data
Script separates columns, removes erroneous variables and names columns appropriately.  It also merges the data into
one data frame which has been ordered.
